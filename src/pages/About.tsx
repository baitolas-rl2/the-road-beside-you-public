            <span className="font-hand text-2xl text-sakura-700 dark:text-sakura-300">Nostalgic Memories</span> is a 
            digital tribute to the golden era of anime aesthetics, particularly focusing on the artistic style popularized 
            by Studio Ghibli and other iconic animation studios from the 1980s and 1990s.

          <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            The collection draws inspiration from classics like "Whisper of the Heart," "Only Yesterday," and "Ocean Waves" 
            - films that captured everyday moments with extraordinary beauty and emotional depth. We're particularly drawn to 
            the way these works portrayed relationships, both romantic and platonic, with such nuance and authenticity.

          <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Each illustration in our collection emphasizes the hallmarks of classic anime: the delicate line work, 
            soft color palettes, and attention to small details that create atmosphere. We're particularly focused on 
            capturing those fleeting, intimate moments between characters - a shared glance, hands almost touching, 
            or figures silhouetted against beautiful backgrounds.
